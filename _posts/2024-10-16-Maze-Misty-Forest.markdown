## Misty Forest: Interactive Maze Web Game
Misty Forest is a web game developed with JavaFX, where players must navigate a maze with limited vision to find treasure chests, collect stars, and evade pursuing ghosts.

Randomized Treasure Chests: The contents of treasure chests are randomly generated—they may contain stars or lurking ghosts.

Ghost Pursuit: Ghosts on the map have intelligent pathfinding and will chase the player upon detection. Players can press the “F” key to freeze ghosts temporarily or attempt to escape.

Interaction & Vision: Players control their character using the keyboard (WASD keys) and adjust their field of view using the left and right mouse buttons. Expanding the field of view allows players to see ghosts—but once a ghost is spotted, it will also notice the player and start chasing.

Win/Loss Conditions: The game is won by collecting three stars. If the player is caught by ghosts too many times and loses all health, the game is lost.
