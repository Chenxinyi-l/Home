## TIDEBREAKERS - Digital Interactive Art Game
TIDEBREAKERS is a creative project that was showcased on December 18, 2024, at "THE COMMON" Design Exhibition at the ENS building in Paris. Through an interactive game format, the project guides viewers to deeply reflect on environmental protection and global climate change issues.

The project focuses on the current state of global carbon emissions. Traditional environmental advocacy often emphasizes individual actions (such as water conservation, waste sorting, and reducing plastic use), but TIDEBREAKERS aims to raise awareness that real, effective change requires large-scale systemic reforms targeting global production systems, energy policies, and corporate responsibilities. The climate crisis presents a significant asymmetry of power and responsibility. On one hand, corporations and major nations dominate global carbon emissions; on the other hand, the most vulnerable communities bear the greatest consequences of the climate crisis. TIDEBREAKERS prompts viewers to reflect on how to trace "responsibility" back to the source of power—the conflict between the capitalist economic growth model and environmental protection—rather than overburdening ordinary people. Through interactive gameplay, viewers not only reflect on the relationship between their own actions and the environment but also stimulate a deeper environmental awareness. Each participation is a profound reflection on global environmental challenges and provides motivation for driving more effective change.

Visitors can access the web game by scanning the QR code at the exhibition and participate in a challenging interactive experience. The gameplay is simple: players click on trash bins to burn trash, accumulating points while destroying the bins. The system provides real-time feedback on the environmental impact of their actions. When multiple players scan the QR code, they will participate in the game together. Once their individual countdowns end, the system will display "GAME OVER" and show the players' final scores. Ultimately, players will realize that no matter how hard individuals try, they cannot clean up the trash bins produced by large corporations.
