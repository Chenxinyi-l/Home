  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
Hi! I'm a master's student in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at Université Paris-Saclay. As a passionate HCIer, I'm deeply interested in the intersection of technology, design, and human behavior. My academic journey has been driven by a curiosity about how interactive systems can be crafted to better serve people — not only in terms of functionality but also in how they feel and connect.

Guided by the principle of seeking truth from facts, my design practice is rooted in addressing real-world challenges and enabling individuals to pursue more ideal modes of living. Whether mitigating everyday difficulties or contributing to broader societal well-being, I view each design decision as a deliberate act—an informed vote of confidence in the possibility of a more equitable and thoughtful world.
